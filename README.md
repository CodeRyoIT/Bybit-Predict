# Bybit-Predict
Predict cryptocurrency trends using Python and the Bybit exchange API



---

This code define a function called KLineStatus that retrieves and processes cryptocurrency data from the Bybit API. This function takes in two arguments: times and Name. times is a time parameter that specifies which data to retrieve, and Name is a string that specifies the cryptocurrency pair to retrieve data for.

The function first initializes an unauthenticated HTTP session with the Bybit API using the usdt_perpetual.HTTP function, passing in the Bybit API endpoint URL, the API key, and the API secret as arguments. It then calls the query_kline method on this session to request K-line data for the specified cryptocurrency pair. The interval parameter is set to 240, which corresponds to a 4-hour time interval, and the limit parameter is set to 1, which retrieves only one data point. The from_time parameter is set to the value of the times argument, which specifies the time to retrieve data for.

The function then processes the retrieved data by extracting certain values and appending them to lists. For example, the Open_time list is appended with the Open_time value from the data, the volume list is appended with the volume value, and so on. The function also calculates the average of the last six data points and appends the result to the OP list. Finally, the function returns the Open_time, volume, Open, High, Low, and Close lists.
